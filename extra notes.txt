# Python
zip can iterate 2 lists at the same time, making the code look better
a = "abc"   b = "abe"
for c1, c2 in zip(a, b)


Monotonic stack:
A monotonic stack is a stack whose elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. It contains all qualities that a typical stack has and its elements are all monotonic decreasing or increasing.

The monotonic stack problem is mainly the <!imp>previous/next smaller/larger<!> problem. It maintains monotonicity while popping elements when a new item is pushed into the stack.

to calculate the square root of a number xx, you can use x**(1/2).  like sqr 5 can be treated as 5 ** (1/2)
