2103. Rings and Rods

Input: rings = "B0B6G0R6R0R6G9"
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- The rod labeled 0 holds 3 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.
- The rod labeled 6 holds 3 rings, but it only has red and blue.
- The rod labeled 9 holds only a green ring.
Thus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.

First Try: 
def countPoints(self, rings: str) -> int:
    res = 0
    dict1 = {}
    rods = 1
    while rods < len(rings):
        if rings[rods] not in dict1:
            dict1[rings[rods]] = rings[rods - 1]
        else:
            dict1[rings[rods]] += rings[rods - 1]
        rods += 2
    for i in dict1.values():
        if "R" in i and "B" in i and "G" in i:
            res += 1
    return res
    
Faster solution:
def countPoints(self, r: str) -> int:
    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        i = str(i)
        if 'R'+i in r and 'G'+i in r and 'B'+i in r:
            ans += 1
    return ans
