594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

First try:
# get into hash and sort the hash and calculate
def findLHS(nums):
    dict1 = {}
    for i in nums:
        dict1[i] = 1 + dict1.get(i , 0)
    res = 0
    temp = 0
    for i , v in dict1.items():
        if i +1 in dict1:
            temp += v
            temp += dict1[i + 1]
        res = max(temp, res)
        temp = 0
    return res
    
  Alternative solutions uses counter, which is similar
