class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        first = max(nums)
        nums.remove(first)
        second = max(nums)
        first -= 1
        second -= 1
        return first * second
        
Something different:
class Solution(object):
    def maxProduct(self, nums):

        first, second = 0, 0
        
        for number in nums:
            
            if number > first:
                # update first largest and second largest
                first, second = number, first
                
            elif number > second:
                # update second largest
                second = number
        
        return (first - 1) * (second - 1)
