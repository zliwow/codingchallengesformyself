1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix

Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

First attempt:

loop through every row, then count from back for negatives, break when else

class Solution:
    def countNegatives(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in grid:
            for j in i[::-1]:
                if j < 0:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    break
        return count

Faster solution with binary search: 
class Solution:
    def countNegatives(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        c = 0
        for i in grid:
            l = 0
            r = len(i)
            while r > l:
                mid = l + (r - l) // 2
                if i[mid] < 0:
                    r = mid
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            c += len(i) - l
        return c
