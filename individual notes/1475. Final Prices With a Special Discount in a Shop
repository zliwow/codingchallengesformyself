1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.


Inital solution:

class Solution:
    def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            base = prices[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
                compare = prices[j]
                if compare <= base:
                    prices[i] = base - compare
                    break
        return prices

Better Solution with monotonous stack:


class Solution:
    def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            while stack and (prices[stack[-1]] >= prices[i]):
                prices[stack.pop()] -= prices[i]
            stack.append(i)
        return prices
