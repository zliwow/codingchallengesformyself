1323. Maximum 69 Number
You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).
Example 1:

Input: num = 9669
Output: 9969
Explanation: 
Changing the first digit results in 6669.
Changing the second digit results in 9969.
Changing the third digit results in 9699.
Changing the fourth digit results in 9666.
The maximum number is 9969.


1st attempt
def maximum69Number (self, num: int) -> int:
    num = list(str(num))
    for i in range(len(num)):
        if num[i] == "6":
            num[i] = '9'
            break
    return int(''.join(num))
    
Interesting solution without turning to string:

def maximum69Number (self, num):
        i = 1000
        while i > 0:
            if num / i % 9 != 0:
                return num + 3 * i
            i /= 10
        return num
